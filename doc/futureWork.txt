Enable Google Cloud Messaging
-----------------------------
Create restDatasource that connects to google cloud messaging

Cursor lists operations
-----------------------
List operations may return a IResult<List<IResult<Model>>>. A first operation should return a list that know how many items are there. Next queries will fetch the items itsef.

Enable models that are not identificable models
-----------------------------------------------
There should be a class that defines, for a model, how to create a unique query to the database and server.
Note that all operations recieve a model instead of a string, so that there will not be need to change this.
To the database:
We may use annotations for identifying the composed ids.
To the server:
We will need a way to map more than one id to a rest mapping: RailsMapping will not work.
Id generation:
There must be a way to generate new ids.


Batch insert of models
-----------------------------------------------
There should be a way to insert many items at batch as in FlightCheap to increase speed.


Update dabase on model change
-----------------------------------------------
option 1 - dirty but may work:
1. Store each sql query used to create a table.
2. On start compare for each table
3. If changed, create new table, add old data, delete old table and rename.
Foreign keys may not work but we don't have foreign keys right now...
