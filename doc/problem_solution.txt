1.Synch and Foreign queries
Problem
When we sycnhronize, we may get an entity related to a non existing one. This will break foreign keys

Solution 1.
Flexible: une no foreing keys
Solution 2 (Adopted)
Set an order when synchornizing so we traverse the relation tree from bottom-top. The relations MUST be a tree, not a graph.
What we do if there is a graph? We can convert a graph to a tree deleting some edges. We will need to define soft-relations (using annotations) to break the graph to a tree. This soft edges will not use foreign keys (flexible edges).

Work to do
1. Create algorith that creates relation tree (breaks if graph) to define order of syncronization.
2. Use order in synch
3. Enable soft links
